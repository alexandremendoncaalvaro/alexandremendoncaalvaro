## **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**

### **Ambev Tech (AB InBev) | *Software Architect & Tech Lead***

*Brazil | Jun 2016 – Present*

*Leading the engineering of **SODA Vision**, the company's proprietary end-to-end Computer Vision platform utilized by continuous improvement teams across factories worldwide.*

* **Cloud-to-Edge Architecture:** Architected the core ecosystem, successfully decoupling the Cloud-based ML Editor (training/management) from the deterministic Edge Runner (C++/Python inference), ensuring reliable execution on resource-constrained factory hardware.  
* **Production Edge Deployment:** Developed "Soda Lens", a standardized edge sensor node architecture that executes vision inference entirely offline and publishes real-time results via **OPC UA** to the corporate ETL.  
* **Technical Leadership:** Created a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to standardize industrial vision pipelines, and mentored engineering teams in adopting strong software practices to ensure platform reliability.  
* **Innovation:** Co-invented the "LAHBS Box," an intrapreneurship program that successfully scaled into a commercial offering for external markets.

### **Baunilha Systems (Technical Consultancy) | Principal AI Architect & Tech Lead**

*Remote / Brazil | Feb 2024 – Present*

*Acting as a principal consultant delivering custom Computer Vision and Edge AI solutions for global enterprise clients, operating end-to-end from software architecture to physical deployment.*

* **Global Edge AI Deployment (Colgate-Palmolive):** Architected and deployed a Deep Learning visual inspection system to replace legacy sensors in high-speed production lines.  
* **Hardware & Field Integration:** Led the on-site physical installation, calibration, and integration of GPU-accelerated Industrial PCs across facilities in the **USA and Mexico**.  
* **Reliable Engineering:** Engineered offline-first capabilities and fail-safe redundancy, drastically reducing false rejection rates and enabling real-time quality analytics at scale.  
* **Industrial IoT Ecosystems:** Engineered a robust fleet management system for remote Edge devices using **Balena IoT**, ensuring reliable Over-The-Air (OTA) updates in low-connectivity environments.

### **Automation Engineer & Tech Lead | *Bosch Rexroth / TTM / Mayekawa***

*Brazil | 2007 – 2016*

*Engineered high-reliability control software and logic for critical infrastructure and heavy industry projects.*

* **Mission-Critical Systems:** Developed fault-tolerant automation logic for strategic physical infrastructure, including subsea manifolds for **Petrobras (Offshore)**, emergency response vehicles for **Infraero**, and the main sluice control for Argentina's largest wastewater treatment plant.  
* **Engineering Foundation:** Built a strong foundation in Industrial Software Engineering (PLC, Industrial Hardware Integration), C\#, C++, and industrial protocols (Modbus, SCADA), embedding a pragmatic, failure-resistant approach to software engineering applied to modern AI systems today.
