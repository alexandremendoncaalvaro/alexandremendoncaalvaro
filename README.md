**Senior AI Engineer | Edge & Systems Architect | Polyglot Problem Solver**

I am a Software Architect with over 15 years of experience bridging the gap between mission-critical hardware (OT) and modern Cloud/AI architecture (IT). I don't just train models; I engineer **robust, offline-first ecosystems** that solve physical problems in the real world.

My background stems from heavy industrial automation (offshore oil & gas, critical infrastructure), which embedded a deep, fail-safe pragmatism into my engineering DNA. Today, I apply that same mission-critical mindset to deploying scalable AI and Computer Vision to the Edge.

### Engineering Philosophy

* **Fail-Safe by Design:** If a system interacts with the physical world, it must be fault-tolerant. I specialize in deterministic, offline-first execution at the Edge.
* **Spec-Driven Design & AI-Augmented Engineering:** I leverage AI (LLMs) not just as a product feature, but as a force multiplier in my daily workflow to write highly robust, test-covered code and bulletproof architectures.
* **The Right Tool for the Job:** From writing C++ for constrained hardware to architecting high-level Cloud environments in Python or C#/.NET, I focus on the problem, not the syntax.

### What I Build (Production Focus)

* **Industrial Computer Vision:** End-to-end proprietary CV platforms and GPU-accelerated edge deployments (replacing legacy sensors with deep learning).
* **Edge-to-Cloud Ecosystems:** Decoupled architectures, IoT fleet management (Balena, Docker), and secure telemetry (OPC UA, MQTT) from offline environments.
* **System Architecture:** Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) for enterprise scalability.

### The Lab (Internal R&D)

Beyond enterprise production, I run a home lab with dedicated servers where I continuously experiment with the bleeding edge of AI:
* Evaluating advanced Vision Transformers (**SAM3**) and the latest **YOLO** architectures.
* Prototyping local **LLM** workflows, **RAG** architectures (with LangChain), and workflow automations (**n8n**).
* Exploring the intersection of generative AI and physical systems.
